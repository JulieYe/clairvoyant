CFFEX is a child class of Matchy, which has 2 major test tasks:

1. Check if preLoadData and init methods work as advertised in the constructor, using test data IF.test.csv.

2. In the process() method paired with Strategy class, check it follows the logic:
   (a) clear inbound messages (limitOrderMessages_, marketOrderMessages_, cancelLimitOrderMessages_, cancelMarketOrderMessages_), which have been processed during the last process
   (b) clear outbound messages (acknowledgedOrderMessages_, filledOrderMessages_, canceledLimitOrderMessages_, canceledMarketOrderMessages_, rejectedLimitOrderMessages_, rejectedMarketOrderMessages_), which have been passed to simulator core and consumed by Strategy class in the last round
   (c) clear outbound tradeUpdates_ and bookUpdates_, which have been passed to simuator core and consumed by Strategy class in the last round
   (d) while there is still data to consume and the data timestamp is earlier than or equal to the simulator core timestamp, match market orders and update filled messages, match bid limit orders and update filled messages, match ask limit orders and update filled messages, push market data to bookUpdates_ and tradeUpdates_ while loading the next available market data
   (e) move inbound messages to internal order book, reject cancel orders if cannot cancel due to order has been completely filled or cancel order timestamp ealier than order timestamp
