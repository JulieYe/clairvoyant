Mostly validate the *Helper methods and count* methods.

1. Check copy constructor and assignment operator.

2. Create OrderBook class with default constructor,
   (a) add a buy limit order, check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (b) add a buy limit order with lower price than (a), check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (c) add a buy limit order with high price than (a), check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (d) add a buy limit order with the same price as (a) but different timestamp, check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (e) repeat (a)-(d) and check askLimitOrderBook_
   (f) add a market order, check marketOrderBook_
   (g) add a market order with different timestamp, check marketOrderBook_
   (h) cancel a market order with different exchangeId_ or contractId_ or orderId_, check marketOrderBook_
   (i) cancel a market order with same exchangeId_, contractId_, orderId_, different timestamps, check marketOrderBook_
   (j) cancel buy limit order for (a)-(d), check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (k) cancel sell limit order for (e), check askLimitOrderBook_
   (l) update on FilledOrderMessage for MarketOrderMessage (partial fill & complete fill), check marketOrderBook_
   (m) update on FilledOrderMessage for buy LimitOrderMessage (partial fill & complete fill), check bidLimitOrderBook_
   (n) update on FilledOrderMessage for sell LimitOrderMessage (partial fill & complete fill), check askLimitOrderBook_

3. Check count method:
   (a) at stage 2.(d), count buy limit orders, count total qty of buy limit orders
   (b) at stage 2.(e), count sell limit orders, count total qty of sell limit orders
   (c) at stage 2.(g), count market orders, count total qty of market orders
   (d) at stage 2.(n), count everything and make sure they are consistent with the cancel and update
