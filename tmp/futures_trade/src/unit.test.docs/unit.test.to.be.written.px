Mostly make sure numTicks_ describes the interger of tickSize_ / rawPx_.

1. Test copy constructor, assignment operator.

2. Test setPx, setTickSize methods so that numTicks_ is changed accordingly.

3. Create a huge vector of Px's and tested the comparison methods using sort algorithm.

4. Test rounding.

5. Test overloaded operators + and -.
